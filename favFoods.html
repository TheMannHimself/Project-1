    <p style="grid-area: 1/1/2/4;">This page will tell you a little about my favorite foods from back home.</p>
    <h2 style="grid-area: 2/1/3/4;">Peach tea</h2>
    <img style="grid-area: 3/2/4/4;" src="media/peachTea.jpg" alt="Peach tea in a mason jar surrounded by peaches" height="400">
    <p>Peach tea is one of the most refreshing things to beat the sweltering Texas heat, its cool sweet flavor is second to none. </p>
    <h2 style="grid-area: 4/1/5/4;">Brisket</h2>
    <img style="grid-area: 5/2/6/4;" src="media/brisket.jpeg" alt="Cut brisket" width="400">
    <p>You haven't lived until you've tried a good Texas brisket. Its soft, juicy meat is something you'll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else, in fact, just writing this makes me want to fly back for a piece.</p>
    <h2 style="grid-area: 6/1/7/4;">Fajitas</h2>
    <img style="grid-area: 7/2/8/4;" src="media/fajitas.jpg" alt="beef fajita meet on a skillet with a bed of grilled peppers and onions" width="400">
    <p>My favorite Tex-Mex dish has to be beef fajitas. Their savory flavor brings me back to my childhood. Also, since you make them yourself it's slightly different every time. How can you not like them look, watch them sizzle!</p>
