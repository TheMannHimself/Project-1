    <h1>My favorite Foods!</h1>
    <p>This page will tell you a little about my favorite foods from back home.</p>
    <h2>Peach tea</h2>

    <p>Peach tea is one of the most refreshing things to beat the sweltering Texas heat, its cool sweet flavor is second to none. </p>
    <h2>Brisket</h2>

    <p>You haven't lived until you've tried a good Texas brisket. Its soft, juicy meat is something you'll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else, in fact, just writing this makes me want to fly back for a piece.</p>
    <h2>Fajitas</h2>

    <p>My favorite Tex-Mex dish has to be beef fajitas. Their savory flavor brings me back to my childhood. Also, since you make them yourself it's slightly different every time.</p>
