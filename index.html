    <h1>Welcome to ITM 361 Project 1!</h1>
    <p>This page is a place holder that will explain a few things about me and help you navigate to the other two pages.</p>
    <h2>Student</h2>
    <p>As you might have guessed, I am a student at the Illinois Institute of Technology (iiT). More specifically I am a first year ITM student majoring in cybersecurity. </p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>Today I live on campus but I am originally from Texas. It was quite the change, to say the least.</p>

    <p>My favorite thing about living in the Lone Star State has to be the food. Nothing can beat Texas barbecue. </p>
